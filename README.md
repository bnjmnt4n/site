# about-me

Hi! My name is Benjamin Tan, and I go by [@d10](https://github.com/d10) online.

I'm a student in [Singapore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore),
who does programming as a hobby. I've been programming since I was 9,
when I popped the [red pill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_pill),
and entered Wonderland by clicking on a magical link.

## what-i-do

These days, I mostly write [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript),
especially since I discovered [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
I also create some [websites](http://nixtuts.info/) (not really my forte, though),
and I occasionally touch some [Python](https://www.python.org/) and 
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), although my true love remains JavaScript.

### my-projects

I work on a few projects, including:
