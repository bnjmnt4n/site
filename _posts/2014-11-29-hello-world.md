I’ve decided to start a new blog (again). Over the past few years, I’ve decided over and over again to create a blog, only to delete it after a fee weeks, as I felt that I had a lack of time to maintain a blog, as well as lack of material to post about. This time, I’m creating a blog **again**, but *it’s here to stay*.

In this blog, I’ll post about my various experiences doing programming, especially on web development and JavaScript, although I’ll occasionally post about other technologies. For a start, I’ll be writing several posts about the design of this blog itself, starting sometime soon, over a few weeks.

Many thanks to my friend [Wei En](https://twitter.com/@wei2912), for creating a [blog himself](https://wei2912.github.io/), which inspired me to create this blog.

Here’s to happy blogging!
